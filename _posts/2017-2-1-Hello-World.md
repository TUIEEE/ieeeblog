Hey everyone! We have remodeled our entire website, it can be found at [www.tudev.org](http://www.tudev.org/).
There are links on there to access our OwlConnect page, and social media accounts so you can be updated on new events and other things we do! We also have a calendar on the website, which is a quick way to see the upcoming events for the entire month.

We have also opened this blog, and will be using this as a way of updating people on events and things going on in our department, or other news we hear. We also want to hear what you all think, so if you're working on any personal projects or something interesting for class that you want to share and write about, feel free to contact us and we can publish a post for you!
